                   scientific knowledge production as a central area of focus.
                   As AI becomes increasingly integrated into scientific
                   research, understanding how researchers adapt to it reveals
                   timely opportunities for CSCW research -- particularly in
                   supporting new forms of collaboration, knowledge practices,
                   and infrastructure in AI-driven science. This study
                   quantifies LLM impacts on scientific knowledge production
                   based on an evaluation workflow that combines an
                   insider-outsider perspective with a knowledge production

                   Rhetorical Design into the design of Explainable Artificial
                   Intelligence (XAI) systems. While XAI is traditionally framed
                   around explaining individual predictions or overall system
                   behavior, explanations also function as a form of
                   argumentation, shaping how users evaluate system perceived
                   usefulness, credibility, and foster appropriate trust.
                   Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the
                   communicative role of explanations between AI systems and
                   users, focusing on: (1) logical reasoning conveyed through
                   different types of explanations, (2) credibility projected by
                   the system and its developers, and (3) emotional resonance
                   elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us
                   understand how explanations influence user perceptions and
                   facilitate AI adoption. This paper synthesizes design

                   fact-checking. In this study, we perceive claim
                   prioritization as an information retrieval (IR) task: just as
                   multidimensional IR relevance, with many factors influencing
                   which search results a user deems relevant, checkworthiness
                   is also multi-faceted, subjective, and even personal, with
                   many factors influencing how fact-checkers triage and select
                   which claims to check. Our study investigates both the
                   multidimensional nature of checkworthiness and effective tool

                   needs while also exploring the design space to meet those
                   needs. Our study with 16 professional fact-checkers
                   investigates: 1) how participants assessed the relative
                   importance of different checkworthy dimensions and apply
                   different priorities in claim selection; 2) how they created
                   customized GPT-based search filters and the corresponding
                   benefits and limitations; and 3) their overall user
                   experiences with our prototype. Our work makes a conceptual
                   contribution between multidimensional IR relevance and

                     as a token of social interactions, the presentation of a
                     gift could impose an identity that reflects gift-givers'
                     images of gift-receivers. Because gift-giving is a social
                     behaviour situated in the cultural and economic context,
                     the perceived value of gifts is greatly affected by the
                     social norms and the consumer market, in which design
                     plays an important role. In this paper, we first discuss
                     how commodities can be transformed into gifts and what
                     kinds of design activities influence such transformations.
                     We found that most relevant designs for commercial gifts
                     are giver-centred with less regard to the concern of
                     gift-receivers. Second, we consider people to be designers
                     themselves, so that each step of the gift-giving could be
                     intentionally framed, influencing the consequences of
                     giving a gift. To this regard, we want to help people
                     identify what affects their perceived differences between
                     thinking of a gift as a token of gratitude or an
                     imposition of identity. We conducted a small design
                     research by designing a gift-giving social game, which
                     situated participants in an imaginary gift-giving
                     environment to understand others' gift preferences.
                     Additionally, the game also helps designers to observe
                     participants' natural reflections on the past experiences
                     and capture their interpretations of gifts and gift-giving
                     based on different human relationships. By presenting
                     preliminary findings from the game playtests, we hope to

              Relationships",

  abstract = "Gifts are experiential objects that are imbued with human
              feelings and also reciprocal objects that invoke social
              interactions. Gifts help to build, enhance, and maintain human
              relationships by forming physical and emotional connections.
              Gifts not only embody aesthetic value via their appearance as
              physical things but also reflect the feelings and routine
              practices of the culture within which they are exchanged.
              However, in the field of design, most scholarship is still
              focused on the gift as a thing rather than the experience
              surrounding it. Designers need to not only explore the physical
              properties of materials when they are designing a product that
              can be given as a gift, but also the related socially ritualized
              behaviors and subjective sensory experiences that those
              properties have embodied. In this thesis, I propose that when
              designing a gift, designers design not only things but also
              experiences. Thus, this thesis explores the emotional and
              subjective meanings surrounding gifts rather than the meanings
              associated with their physical properties.",

  abstract   = "As people grow older, their dependency on various services
                increases. However, these services are being progressively
                mediated by digital technology. Although scholars believe that
                technology adoption could enhance older adults' quality of
                life, little is known about seniors' sense of autonomy while
                using technology. In this study, we conducted ethnographic
                research including surveys and interviews to learn about
                seniors' technology usage in relation to their sense of
                autonomy. We used qualitative and statistical analysis to
                synthesize patterns and used our design research findings to
                inform our service ideation process. In the end, we proposed
                four major service design guidelines to help enhance the
                technology literacy of seniors: a changed mindset from singular
                problem-solving to pluralistic motivations, a meaningful
                learning process embedded in seniors' everyday communication
                needs, ongoing educational support within a sustainable system,
                and the value of integrating humanity with technology.",

  abstract   = "During the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing students were compelled
                to receive remote geriatric education due to social distancing
                mandates. However, for older adults who lack technology
                literacy, there has been limited access to remote nursing
                assistance. Although the mandate has been effective in reducing
                virus transmission, it has imposed a double burden on older
                adults' social isolation and has also restricted traditional
                geriatric nursing education for nursing students. To reconnect
                nursing students with older adults, we present research
                evaluating existing remote educational strategies in isolated
                care of older adults. We conducted surveys with nursing
                students and older adults to examine the extent of social
                deprivation during COVID-19 and their desires and needs in
                current remote care. These findings then informed our designs
                for interventions to connect more deeply with older adults,
                including thematic games, digital journals and information
                flyers for virtual and face-to-face assessments to support

                technologically literate as younger populations. They do not
                seek digital services, such as online banking and ridesharing
                services, as readily as younger people and are therefore
                isolated from these services benefits. In this project, we
                adopted personal autonomy and communal participation as
                principles for designing services to improve older adults'
                technology learning experiences. We began the research by
                conducting surveys and interviews to better understand how
                older adults use digital technologies and how their
                interactions with these technologies are interrelated with
                their sense of autonomy and participation. Factor and cluster
                analyses were used to determine the correlation between older
                adults' self-autonomous behaviours and the digital technologies
                they use daily. Employing quantitative and qualitative
                analyses, we developed three types of personas based on older
                adults' technology-literacy levels, motivations, and barriers.
                In partnership with a local senior living community, we
                proposed an educational service to improve older adults'
                technology literacy and prototyped three community games to
                address the specific problems that older adults experience
                while learning digital technologies. Due to the outbreak of the
                COVID-19 pandemic, we remotely tested these games with
                coordinators and educators from local senior centres. This
                research's findings also influenced the design of a service to
                support isolated older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
